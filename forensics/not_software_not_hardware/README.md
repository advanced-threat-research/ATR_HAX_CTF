## Description
I grabbed this file from a Wireshark capture of one of my home devices doing an update of some kind. Can you find the flag?

NOTE: The format of the flag is ATR\[\], for example: ATR\[foobar\]. The flag must be submitted in full, including the ATR and square bracket parts.

## Hint
The hint is in the file ".hint"
