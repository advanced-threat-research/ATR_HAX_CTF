# Shellcode Hollaback

### 500 Points

## Description
<p>After days of reversing a certain <b>x86-64 target running Linux</b>, you're finally able to <b>execute up to 64 bytes of shellcode</b>. You also know the location of a function <b>(0xAAAAAAAAAAAA)</b> that will store a username and password. You can then use these credentials to retrieve the flag. Thankfully, symbols were left in.

NOTE: The format of the flag is ATR\[\], for example: ATR\[foobar\]. The flag must be submitted in full, including the ATR and square bracket parts.
