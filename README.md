# McAfee ATR Capture the Flag
## 2021 ATRHAX CTF Challenges

Based on feedback from our many CTF players, we've decided to release solutions for each of our CTF challenges. We thought it would be fun to provide solutions from one of the winning teams from our internal competition in late 2019 (these are the same challenges used in our public CTF from February 2021). You may have found a different solution as well, which is the entire point of these. Hope you enjoyed and look forward to a strong showing in our 2021-2022 public CTF.
